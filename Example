## Introduction
In this section, we will show you how to use our functions to find locate brain regions and check nifti file attributes

### Data 
The data we will use in the examples be the `rest.nii` file from patient 10020,  which is a rs-fMRI dataset for a control subject from the ADHD-200 Preprocessed sample from the International Neuroimaging Datasharing Initiative (INDI)
http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/adhd200/index.html

### Functions
Here, we will use two functions, `plot_brain_regions` and `inspect_nifti_file`.

`plot_brain_regions` is a function to plot the locations of different regions of the brain

`inspect_nifti_file` is a function to find the shape, voxel size and affine matrix of a nifti file.

`masked_glass_plot` is a function that converts from 4D to 3D and plots a glass brain plot using masked data

Below are all the arguments in `plot_brain_regions`
```python
plot_brain_regions(regions_names: list)
```

Below are all the arguments in `inspect_nifti_file`
```python
inspect_nifti_file(nifti_path)
```
Below are the arguments in `masked_glass_plot`
```python
masked_glass_plot(file_path, volume_index=0)
```

### Application

We will first show `plot_brain_regions` apply the aal_labels file, containing the region names that will be searched in the function 

```python
plot_brain_regions(["Precentral_L", "Precentral_R", "Frontal_Sup_R"])
```
